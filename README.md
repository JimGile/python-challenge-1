# Module 2 Challenge - Food Truck Menu Ordering

The menu.py script allows the user to select a menu category from a list of
first level keys in the menu dictionary. It then displays a list of 
menu items from the selected menu category. The user can then select
an item from the list and enter the quantity that they want to order. 
When the user is done ordering, it calculates the total cost of the 
order and prints a reciept to the console.
